Title:  
Fact: Superdelegates Have Never Determined The Democratic Nominee

Text: 
As the Democratic Primary heats up heading into yet another  Super Tuesday   where Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Maryland, Delaware and Connecticut will decide who to support for the 2016 presidential election, questions (and hostilities) are flaring up yet again over the designation of superdelegates.Questions remain whether or not Hillary Clinton will be able to amass the 2,383 delegates needed to secure a nomination without the support of superdelegates. Clinton s campaign says they are not worried about falling short, but Jane Sanders, wife of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, thinks otherwise. However, after a crushing blow in New York, team Sanders has had to come up with a new strategy if they hope to win the nomination   that strategy, according to reports, is to persuade superdelegates to back him, a move the Clinton campaign has cried foul on.But in all, it really doesn t matter one way or another. What many people may not know is the superdelegate system, since its introduction in the 1984 election, has never determined who the Democratic nominee is.That s right. Superdelegates have never been responsible for putting Walter Mondale, Michael Dukakis, Bill Clinton, Al Gore, John Kerry or Barack Obama on the national stage for the general election. In 2008, the primary showdown between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton was even closer than it is now, and still superdelegates weren t responsible for Obama s win.While appearing on Fox News with Maria Bartiromo, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, head of the DNC and a congresswoman from Florida, reminded audiences of this crucial fact, as hostility intensifies within the party.Politifact decided to fact check this claim, using information and second opinions from a multitude of political scientists, and concluded that Wasserman Schultz is right (with one little detail left out), and gave the rating as  Mostly True,  writing:The first election where Democrats used superdelegates was in 1984, where they helped Mondale secure the nomination on the first ballot at the convention. It s not clear that they were the  determining  factor. Some say Mondale would have won without them.Since that time, a Democrat has won the nomination early enough where the superdelegates haven t mattered.What that means is the elections between two candidates (or more) in the Democratic primary have never been so close that superdelegates were needed to break the  tie  or push one candidate over the edge to victory. By the time the conventions have rolled around, it s been clear who the people (and pledged delegates) have picked.Only Mondale got help with superdelegates, but sources differ on whether they determined his win.Essentially, the superdelegates have been a symbolic vote by those within the Democratic ranks as to see which direction they want the party to head in. But why should we have them, then? According to the Wasserman Schultz, their purpose is to make sure that party activists who want to be delegates to the convention don t have to run against much better-known and well-established people at the district level. So whether or not you love them or hate them, just remember they have never been responsible for nominating the candidate you love or hate. Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

Ben Shapiro Escalates Kanye Feud With Release Of Epic Diss Track

Text: 
BOCA RATON, FL — Over the past few weeks, Ben Shapiro has created video responses to Kanye "Ye" West's anti-semitic statements, causing West to direct tweets at the conservative commentator. Shapiro further escalated the situation this week by releasing an epic diss track that industry analysts say spells the end of "Ye's" career. "The smooth flow, the torrent of staccato attacks on Ye's artistic talents and hateful views, and pounding rhythm make this song the crescendo of what will absolutely be remembered as the greatest feud in the history of rap," said Youtuber and music critic Anthony Fantano on his channel. He went on to detail other famous battles in the history of hip-hop, chronicling the genre's most bitter feuds until Ye and Ben began trading barbs in speedily-delivered rap songs and faster-talking podcasts. Shapiro, who now goes by "50 Shekels," unambiguously calls out the longtime rap and fashion icon in "No Sabbath Rest For The Wicked, Ok Gang?" which was released Monday. After "50 Sheks" opens with the simple bars "At the Daily Wire / I'm spittin' fire," he launches into a series of complex rhymes enumerating his plans to decimate Ye: I'll take you to school I'll be your proctor You need some ice for that burn? Well, my wife's a doctor The song includes a clear defense of Jews and Judaism as well, including a segue into an interlude: Despite what you think Jews ain't money-hungry monsters I'll explain it to ya more But first a word from our sponsor The main praise for the newly-minted rapper is that he is able to rhyme with a wide variety of phrases with "use promo code BEN," including veiled threats against Ye's online security: "If you try to ‘Make Antisemitism Great Again,' you'd better protect your data with express VPN." Critics have given mixed reviews of the diss track's fifth verse, citing "thin" and "flimsy" thematic connections between Shapiro's boasts of plans to put Ye's career to "bed" with a clunky transition into the importance of acquiring a personalized, high-quality mattress for up to $350 off + 2 FREE Pillows with all mattress orders on HelixSleep.com/Ben. Praise has been unanimous, however, for the track's final verse, which achieves impressive rhymes and indicates that Shapiro is just getting started: "I'm rolling up my sleeves, takin' off my yarmulke / Gonna uppercut Ye into Andromeda." An album of sonnets by Michael Knowles, gangster rap by Matt Walsh, and razor-related rap from Jeremy Boreing have already been announced to arrive from Daily Wire Records this Spring.

Thousands Of Pedophiles Serve Less Than One Year In California Prisons: Report

Text: 
Thousands of convicted pedophiles in California served less than a year in prison after committing lewd or lascivious acts with a child under 14 years old, according to an investigative report. The Daily Mail analyzed a statewide database of sex offenders that showed more than 7,000 child molesters were released within months after federal authorities sentenced them to prison. Former Los Angeles sex crimes prosecutor Samuel Dordulian told Daily Mail that the statistics “shocked” him, adding the reality is “frightening for society.” “Statistics clearly show that pedophiles don’t get reformed,” Dordulian said. “They’re going to come out, and they’re going to commit again. Letting these people out early, we’re allowing for a lot more victimization — and that’s terrifying.” California law requires sex offenders to register their address and update their location upon moving with the Department of Justice. Those names and other personal details are then placed in a public database under Megan’s Law, which the Clinton administration passed in 1996 after a pedophile murdered 7-year-old Megan Kanka. According to the report, 54,986 sex offenders were listed on the website in July 2019, of which 76% committed offenses involving children. The average pedophile served two years and ten months in prison. One of the examples outlined in the Daily Mail report said an offender in the database named Carlos Alexander Nahue, 48, of Reseda, California, lives one block from Royal Montessori School daycare and three blocks from Reseda Elementary School after allegedly being convicted of “continuous sexual abuse of a child” in 2015. Authorities charged Nahue in October 2014. He pled no contest to the crime in January 2015, which resulted in a judge sentencing him to only two days in an L.A. county jail and five years of probation. According to the database, some pedophiles committed misdemeanors, such as indecent exposure or attempting to send lewd pictures to children, and convicts received less jail time. However, the most common offenses were “lewd or lascivious acts” against children under 14 years old, and 7,152 pedophiles who committed this crime served less than a year. Dordulian said the statistics were “‘surprisingly very low.” “In my days [in the L.A. DA’s office], we made every effort to get as long of a prison sentence as we could because we knew that the minute they’re going to come out, they’re more likely to re-offend and another child’s gonna get harmed,” he told Daily Mail. Dordulian said as a lawyer who represents victims of sexual abuse, California Governor Gavin Newsom’s policies shorten prison sentences to reduce the population locked up. “That has been the push for the last at least five years: letting people out of prison much earlier than what their sentences were for,” he said. “But these types of individuals, they’re not amenable to rehabilitation, and studies have shown that. They’re gonna harm another child — It’s a very, very scary trend.” A spokesperson for the state’s attorney general told Daily Mail that “public safety is a top priority for the California Department of Justice,” adding that the issue generally falls on the responsibility of local district attorneys, courts, and state lawmakers. “Our office actively works with law enforcement across the state to protect our state’s children and families, whether that’s through conducting sting operations targeting sexual predators, issuing guidance to reduce harm to sexually exploited youth, or launching Human Trafficking and Sexual Predator Apprehension Teams,” the spokesperson said. Deputy District Attorney Jon Hatami, a child abuse prosecutor in the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office, said the situation was “a disgrace” to Daily Mail, adding the problem is only getting worse under his boss George Gascón, who supported Proposition 57, which allows early parole for nonviolent felons. “Thousands of child victims are being denied justice, and George Gascón and his group of radical prosecutors can care less,” Hatami said. Hatami said the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation stopped notifying the child victims and their families of such early releases. “It’s shameful,” he said. “Furthermore, most of these sex offenders who are released early have not been rehabilitated whatsoever. This will clearly endanger our future generation of children and our entire community — it’s a disgrace that the state of California is not prioritizing the safety and well-being of our children.”

Trump Disappointed After Holocaust Denier Tells Him Holocaust Never Happened

Text: 
PALM BEACH, FL—Appearing crestfallen during a dinner with the white supremacist at his Mar-a-Lago estate, former President Donald Trump is said to have expressed deep sadness last week when he was told by Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes that the Holocaust never happened. “Wait, so all those stories I heard as a child about the systematic slaughter of 6 million Jews—those were just a fantasy?” said Trump, slumping his head and letting out a long sigh as he reportedly began to accept the belief that Adolf Hitler and his Nazis had not rounded up Jews and other marginalized people, shipped them to concentration camps, and exterminated as many as possible. “This is terrible news, what you’re telling me, absolutely terrible. Even Kristallnacht? I guess they just weren’t able to go through with it or something. That’s so sad.” According to sources, Fuentes comforted Trump by assuring him that if they worked together, the Holocaust did not have to remain a fantasy.
